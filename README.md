## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue is used in this project due to its simplicity and ease of integration with other libraries or existing projects.

- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

- **Pinia**: State management library for Vue. It's intuitive and provides a straightforward way of managing state in Vue applications. It's used in this project to manage the state of the todo items.

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Axios is used in this project to handle API requests.

- **TypeScript**: A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking. TypeScript is used in this project to help catch errors during development and to provide a more robust codebase.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Tailwind is used in this project for its flexibility and efficiency in styling components.

## Mock API

This project uses a mock API for handling todo items. The mock API simulates the behavior of a real API but doesn't have any real side effects. 

The mock API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items. It uses JSON Server, which creates a RESTful API based on a JSON file.
